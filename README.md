# BlockSunflower17
BlockSunflower17 containes the game "Garden Defense" which is inspired from 'Plants vs Zombies'. In our game, the currency in the world is "suns" which the player can use to buy plants. These can be placed in a garden to block the incoming zombies from reaching the house. Certain plants are better for slowing down the zombies from getting to the house while other plants are better for attacking the zombies to decrease their health. The game ends when either the zombies get to the house or there are no more zombies that go to the house. 

# Installation
To install, go to the link https://github.com/nicholas-mclaughlin/BlockSunflower17 click on the green "clocne or download" button to dowload all the files in a zip file, including the images on there. When extracting this zip file, make sure that the images.css file as well as all the images are in the main java project folder BlockSunflower17, if they are not already there. As well, ensure that the java project folder has a src (source) folder with a default package inside it. All the classes should be inside the default package.

# Running and Compiling
To compile the code, on your computer, through the command prompt, navigate to where the BlockSunflower17 folder is installed, and compile the class 'Session.java'. To run the code, after compiling, type in 'java Session'. If using an IDE, simply run the Session class as a Java application. Once the game starts running, click start to begin playing.

## Technologies needed
This game uses Java and JavaFX. If running in the Eclipse IDE, an external *.jar file would be needed in the java project folder.

# Version 2
This is the second iteration of our game that now contains a GUI. The plants and zombies are not interacting yet, and the suns have not yet been created.
